## [Unreleased]

## [1.8.4] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Added a new Chinese voice end command preset for saying `好了`.

### Changed
- Expanded the built-in local MLX speech model list with more Qwen3 ASR, Voxtral, Parakeet, Granite, FireRed, and SenseVoice options.

### Fixed
- Fixed remote provider credentials so API keys and tokens are stored in the macOS keychain instead of exported preferences.
- Fixed sided modifier shortcut recording so left and right modifier keys are captured more reliably.

## [1.8.3] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Fixed permission warnings so Settings only asks for permissions that are actually required by enabled features.
- Fixed App Branch matching so groups with an empty prompt no longer override the default enhancement flow.
- Fixed rewrite output handling so the answer card stays available more reliably when that mode is enabled.
- Improved meeting detail timing and summary defaults for clearer post-meeting review.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- Fixed the local Whisper transcription dependency so Voxt builds reliably with the current Xcode toolchain.
- Fixed custom select controls in Settings so choosing a different option updates immediately again.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-03-25

### Changed
- Lowered the minimum supported macOS version to 15.0 so Voxt can run on more Macs.

### Fixed
- Improved compatibility on macOS 15 by gracefully falling back when Apple Intelligence features or newer system audio APIs are unavailable.
- Added clearer diagnostics around microphone connect and disconnect handling, device priority evaluation, and automatic microphone switching.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Added an AI meeting summary sidebar with saved summaries and follow-up chat directly inside Meeting details.
- Added a screen sharing toggle in the meeting overlay so meeting captures can include shared-screen context when needed.

### Changed
- Refreshed the settings and Meeting detail interfaces with more consistent controls, layouts, and localized guidance.

### Fixed
- Improved meeting summary and onboarding reliability with tighter prompt handling and more isolated preference test coverage.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- Added a first-run setup guide in the main window with step-by-step onboarding for language, models, transcription, translation, rewrite, app enhancement, and meeting notes.

### Changed
- Refined the onboarding flow with simpler shortcut presets, contextual permission prompts, inline demo videos, and localized guidance across English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese.

### Fixed
- Fixed meeting transcript translation updates so existing translated text stays visible while background refreshes complete, instead of flashing a loading state on every update.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- Added a separate on-device Whisper engine powered by WhisperKit, with built-in Whisper model downloads and configurable realtime, VAD, timestamp, and temperature options.
- Added Meeting Notes (Beta), a dedicated long-running meeting capture flow with its own shortcut, floating meeting card, Meeting history entries, and detail window review/export support.
- Added meeting-specific Remote ASR setup for Doubao ASR and Aliyun Bailian ASR, including dedicated Meeting ASR model selection and request-path testing.

### Changed
- Refined the meeting capture experience with clearer model initialization states, pause/resume controls, timestamped segments, click-to-copy, and smoother long-running overlay behavior.
- Expanded localization and configuration transfer coverage for the new meeting workflow and Whisper settings across English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese.

### Fixed
- Fixed `fn` hotkey recovery after idle and hardened recording start handling so shortcut-triggered capture sessions resume more reliably.
- Improved Whisper startup and meeting control stability during longer transcription sessions.

## [1.6.6] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- Added a General setting to cancel the active overlay with `Esc`, plus optional overlay appearance controls for opacity, corner radius, and screen edge distance.
- Added manual dictionary replacement match terms so custom aliases can map directly to a standard term.

### Changed
- Refined the recording waveform so the voice bars now feel like audio waves moving from left to right.

### Fixed
- Reduced idle memory after local MLX transcription or LLM use by unloading on-device models after they sit unused.
- Fixed General configuration export/import so the latest `Esc` cancel and overlay appearance settings are preserved.
- Fixed the permissions page so Speech Recognition only appears when the selected transcription engine actually needs system dictation.

## [1.6.5] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Added built-in Doubao ASR 2.0 and 1.0 model options, with 2.0 now used as the default selection for new setups.

### Fixed
- Fixed Doubao ASR realtime routing so 2.0 now connects through the supported streaming endpoint, while file and connectivity-test flows keep using the compatible endpoint and payload format.
- Reduced extra Doubao diagnostic log noise during normal recording and settings connectivity tests.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Reduced idle and active CPU usage in the status menu and recording overlay by replacing broad menu rebuild triggers with targeted updates and by stopping hidden overlay animations from continuing to drive SwiftUI layout work.
- Improved recording waveform feedback so the voice bars animate more smoothly and remain visually clearer during transcription while keeping the lower CPU overhead.
- Removed answer card button tooltips to reduce redundant hover chrome in the rewrite result UI.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Reissued the latest patch release with Sparkle-compatible plain-text auto-update release notes so update feeds no longer depend on Markdown-formatted release bodies.
- Includes the rewrite overlay, answer injection, dictionary ingest, history UI, and `fn` hotkey fixes shipped in the 1.6.2 patch line.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-03-19

### Changed
- Simplified rewrite output behavior so rewrite always shows the answer card, while keeping the General settings UI aligned with the new fixed behavior.
- Improved dictionary ingest and history surfaces by reducing candidate-only UI noise and surfacing direct dictionary hits more clearly.

### Fixed
- Fixed rewrite answer card actions and loading feedback, including the inject action, loading spinner sizing, and icon alignment in the recording overlay.
- Fixed rewrite answer injection availability by improving focused input detection and adding a safer fallback for apps that do not expose standard accessibility focused elements.
- Fixed modifier-only hotkey handling so `fn` no longer steals unrelated combos such as `fn+1`, while preserving dedicated `fn+shift` and `fn+control` shortcuts.
- Fixed overlay session startup so stale transcription text is cleared before a new recording card appears.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Added a configurable dictionary ingest flow with localized settings copy and model selection controls.

### Changed
- Refined rewrite answer card behavior and related recording overlay handling for rewrite and translation result flows.

### Fixed
- Persisted dictionary ingest model selection across launches and configuration export/import.
- Localized rewrite setting labels consistently across English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese, and fixed settings window stability issues.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Added a dictionary workflow with scoped terms, history-based candidate suggestions, one-click ingestion, and prompt-time dictionary guidance.
- Added user main language selection plus engine hint settings for MLX and remote ASR providers, including provider-specific language handling for OpenAI, GLM, Doubao, and Aliyun.
- Added menu bar microphone switching and a General setting that can mute other apps' media audio during recording after system audio capture permission is granted.

### Changed
- Expanded configuration export/import so it now covers dictionary data, voice end command settings, user main language, ASR hint settings, and the latest General settings additions.
- Improved settings organization and localization for the new dictionary, language, and ASR hint workflows across English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese.

### Fixed
- Fixed custom hotkey recording so modifier-heavy shortcuts are captured more reliably and no longer leak into active global hotkey handling while recording.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- Improved Hotkey settings shortcut capture so newly recorded shortcuts stay pending until the user explicitly confirms them.
- Prevented global hotkey handlers from firing while recording a shortcut in Hotkey settings.
- Improved modifier-only shortcut capture reliability, including better handling for repeated modifier changes during recording.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Added configurable voice end commands in Hotkey settings with presets for `over`, `end`, `完毕`, plus custom command text.
- Added automatic stop from spoken end commands when the command appears at the transcript tail and is followed by about 1 second of silence.
- Added feedback entry points in the About tab and status bar menu, both linked to the GitHub issue chooser.

### Changed
- Updated the About tab tagline to `Voice to Thought` with localized Simplified Chinese copy `思想之声`.
- Refactored voice end command handling into focused recording/session and settings components to reduce coupling across `AppDelegate` and settings views.
- Simplified remote ASR stop flows and session task cleanup by extracting reusable helpers for streaming shutdown and recording lifecycle control.

### Fixed
- Fixed trailing end-command matching so surrounding punctuation, including Asian punctuation such as `，。！？`, is ignored reliably.
- Fixed final transcription output so spoken control commands are stripped from committed text, including when the user manually stops after the command.
- Fixed remote ASR file-recording shutdown to release the microphone capture object immediately after stop instead of holding it until upload/transcription completes.

## [1.4.8] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Added configuration export/import in General settings for app preferences, models, app branch rules, and hotkeys.
- Added model setup warning badges after configuration import to guide users to incomplete provider or model setup.

### Fixed
- Fixed Sparkle no-update results so "already up to date" no longer appears as update check failure in settings.
- Fixed app branch configuration export so group and URL entries are serialized from their stored data payloads.

## [1.4.7] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- Added localized prompt template variable chips with copy interaction and hover tips in settings.
- Added app branch prompt templating support with `{{RAW_TRANSCRIPTION}}`.

- Fixed proxy-disabled networking so WebSocket traffic no longer relies on legacy proxy behavior alone.
- Fixed accessibility permission prompting/registration flow so installed apps register more reliably in macOS Accessibility settings.
- Fixed hotkey matching so right-side modifier shortcuts no longer trigger from left-side keys when left/right distinction is enabled.
- Fixed app branch prompt handling and prompt editor guidance to align with current enhancement behavior.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- Added prompt template variable support for enhancement and translation:
  - Enhancement: `{{RAW_TRANSCRIPTION}}`
  - Translation: `{{TARGET_LANGUAGE}}`, `{{SOURCE_TEXT}}`
- Added prompt variable hints below prompt textareas in model settings (localized in English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese).
- Added OpenAI ASR chunk pseudo-realtime preview option (default off) with explicit usage-cost hint.

### Changed
- Updated default enhancement prompt to the new structured instruction template with strict output constraints.
- Updated default translation prompt to the new structured template with explicit target/source variable blocks and strict translation rules.
- Improved recording overlay waveform visibility and interaction feedback (stronger amplitude response, higher dynamic range, clearer bar rendering).

### Fixed
- Fixed OpenAI ASR preview text rendering/parsing in overlay to avoid JSON-like raw payload display artifacts.
- Fixed update check/install UX to reduce disruptive failure popups and surface status via settings sidebar badge with detail action.

### Refactored
