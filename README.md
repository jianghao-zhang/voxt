[macos install](https://github.com/hehehai/voxt/releases/latest)

## Features

- Global hotkey voice input from any app.
- Two shortcut actions:
  - `Transcription` (normal speech-to-text)
  - `Translation` (speech-to-text then translation)
- Two trigger modes: `Long Press (Release to End)` / `Tap (Press to Toggle)`.
- Hotkey operation semantics:
  - Long Press:
    - Hold transcription hotkey (`fn`) to start transcription, release `fn` to stop.
    - Hold translation hotkey (`fn+shift`) to start translation mode, release `fn+shift` to stop.
  - Tap:
    - Tap transcription hotkey (`fn`) to start, tap `fn` again to stop.
    - Tap translation hotkey (`fn+shift`) to start translation mode.
- Two STT engines:
  - `MLX Audio (On-device)` with local downloadable models
  - `Direct Dictation` powered by Apple Speech
- Two LLM paths:
  - `Apple Intelligence (Foundation Models)`
  - `Custom LLM` (local model)
- Translation target languages: English / Chinese (Simplified) / Japanese / Korean / Spanish / French / German.
- Live floating overlay: waveform, scrolling partial text, processing animation, completion state.
- Smart output option: copy-only when no writable text input is focused.
- Clipboard-safe paste flow: restores previous clipboard content.
- Local transcription history with pagination, copy, delete, clear-all, and `Normal / Translation` tags.
- App Branch enhancement rules with drag-and-drop grouping for apps and URL patterns.
- Browser active-tab URL matching (Chrome / Safari / Arc) with per-browser Automation permission flow.
- Model download manager with progress, cancel, delete, size display, validation, and `hf-mirror.com` support.
- System controls: microphone selection, interaction sounds, launch at login, show in Dock.

## Implementation

1. `CGEvent tap` listens for global shortcuts (transcription and translation are separate).
2. `AVAudioEngine` captures audio and updates live levels.
3. Voxt picks the STT engine based on settings:
   - MLX: staged correction (intermediate + final pass)
   - Dictation: streaming `SFSpeechRecognizer` output
4. Text pipeline by mode:
   - Transcription mode:
     - ASR -> optional enhancement (Off / Apple Intelligence / Custom LLM)
     - Enhancement prompt can come from App Branch (App/URL match) or global fallback.
   - Translation mode:
     - ASR -> enhancement -> translation (two LLM calls)
     - Enhancement stage still uses App Branch prompt routing.
     - Translation stage uses dedicated translation prompt with output-only constraints.
5. Output is injected with clipboard + simulated `Cmd+V`, and metadata can be saved to history.

## Engines

### STT Engines

| Engine | Description | Strength | Typical Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MLX Audio | Runs local MLX STT models | Offline, private, model-selectable | Privacy-focused and tunable setup |
| Direct Dictation | Apple Speech (`SFSpeechRecognizer`) | Zero setup | Fast onboarding without model download |

### Enhancement / Translation Engines

| Engine | Tech Path | Strength | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Apple Intelligence | `FoundationModels` | Native system experience, no extra LLM download | Depends on system availability |
| Custom LLM | Local `MLXLMCommon` + Hugging Face model | Fully local, customizable prompts | Requires model download first |

## Models

### MLX STT Models

- `mlx-community/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B-4bit` (default): balanced speed and quality, lower memory usage.
- `mlx-community/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B-bf16`: quality-first, higher resource usage.
- `mlx-community/Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602-fp16`: realtime-oriented, larger footprint.
- `mlx-community/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3`: lightweight and fast, especially good for English.
- `mlx-community/GLM-ASR-Nano-2512-4bit`: smallest footprint for quick drafts.

### Custom LLM Models

- `Qwen/Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct` (default): general enhancement/translation with lower resource pressure.
- `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct`: stronger formatting/reasoning with higher resource usage.
- `mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit`: balanced Qwen3 quality and performance.
- `mlx-community/Qwen3-8B-4bit`: higher-quality Qwen3 option.
- `mlx-community/GLM-4-9B-0414-4bit`: strong multilingual instruction following.
- `mlx-community/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-4bit`: lightweight local Llama option.
- `mlx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit`: smallest Llama footprint.
- `mlx-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-4bit`: general-purpose 8B Llama.
- `mlx-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-4bit`: refined 8B Llama 3.1 option.
- `mlx-community/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-4bit`: concise instruction-following.
- `mlx-community/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-4bit`: improved Mistral Nemo instruction model.
- `mlx-community/gemma-2-2b-it-4bit`: compact Gemma 2 instruction model.
- `mlx-community/gemma-2-9b-it-4bit`: larger Gemma 2 option for better output quality.

## Model Comparison (Relative)

> Notes: this table is a relative guide based on model positioning and common usage experience, not a fixed cross-device benchmark.
